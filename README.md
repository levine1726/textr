# Textr

Want to be notified of twitter posts based on certain criteria, say concert announcements from an artist you like, while minimizing as much useage of Twitter as possible? This project seeks to leverage AWS services to check a list of twitter handles against a wordbank a user defines, and then text/email you when the criteria is met.
